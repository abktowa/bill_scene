## Consistency guidelines
- When drawing our scene, one unit in the coordanite system will correspond to one foot
- When creating hierarchical models, objects will be centered along the x and z axes, positioned above the ground level, as if theyâ€™re placed on the floor at the y = 0 plane, as shown in the image below.
